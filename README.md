McConnochie et al. (2024) – “IMU-based kinematics using optimal control simulations during running”  https://peerj.com/articles/19035/

This work validated an IMU-based optimal control workflow, demonstrating strong agreement with marker-based motion capture and improved accuracy compared with an IMU-based inverse kinematics approach. A torque-driven model was used, and validation involved analysing 15 strides from six subjects at each of three running speeds (8–14 km/h).

McConnochie et al. (2025) – Modelling Biomechanical Responses to Muscle Fatigue in an Optimal Control Framework: The Role of Running Speed and Fibre Type (preprint)

Building on the validated framework, this study applied a muscle-driven model to investigate the effects of fatigue and running speed on simulated joint kinematics and energetics.
